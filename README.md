## Hi there! I'm Infania, let's dive in...

I design embedded systems for physical–digital products and validate them using in human factors principles and testing. 

My work combines:
- Hardware–software integration  
- Communication protocols (BLE, NFC, WiFi, Serial)  
- System architecture decisions  
- Human factors–driven usability validation  

Currently completing an M.S. in Human Factors Engineering at Tufts University, where my thesis focuses on the designing and validation of a wearable embedded interaction system.

### Featured Projects
- **SociaLIGHT** – Wearable interaction system for real-time social signaling  
- **Componentize (TCL)** – Modular PyScript component library for physical computing
